## 🗃️ Database Tables (MariaDB)

- `rooms` – stores room details and availability
- `customers` – stores customer booking info
- `payments` – stores payment method and transaction info

> 📝 All SQL queries are handled using **PreparedStatements** for security.



## 🚀 How to Run

1. Import the project into **NetBeans IDE** or your favorite Java IDE.
2. Set up **MariaDB** and import the `hotel_db.sql` file.
3. Update `DBConnection.java` with your DB credentials.
4. Add all required external JARs to your project libraries:
   - `iText.jar`
   - `core-3.4.1.jar` (for QR)
5. Run `HotelApp.java` — and you're live!
